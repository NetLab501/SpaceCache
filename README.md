# SpaceCache+: Satellite Cache Deployment

This repository contains the implementation of cache satellite deployment as described in the paper:

**"SpaceCache+: Towards Pervasive Content Delivery via Low-Earth Orbit Mega-Constellations"**

---

## Overview

This codebase provides an optimization framework for selecting cache satellites in large-scale Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations, aiming to enhance global content delivery.  
The core logic implements and extends the methods in the SpaceCache+ paper.

- **Constellation information** (satellite positions, link delays, visibility) must be precomputed using [StarPerf Simulator](https://github.com/SpaceNetLab/StarPerf_Simulator) ([StarPerf Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9259357)).
- The optimization model for cache placement is solved using [Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/).

## Folder Structure

```
satellite_data/         # Output data generated by StarPerf (required input)
analysis.py             # Main script for cache satellite deployment
deployment.py           # Logic for satellite/CDN placement and heuristics
gurobi.py               # Optimization model definition (Gurobi)
```

## Workflow

1. **Generate Satellite Data**  
   Use StarPerf to generate the constellation dynamics (satellite positions, delays, and visibility).  
   - See the [StarPerf GitHub](https://github.com/SpaceNetLab/StarPerf_Simulator) for instructions.
   - Place all generated files in the `satellite_data/` directory.

2. **Run Cache Deployment**  
   The main entry point is `analysis.py`.  
   This script will:
   - Parse StarPerf-generated constellation data
   - Formulate and solve the cache placement problem
   - Output the selected cache satellite IDs for CDN deployment

   Example command:
   ```bash
   python analysis.py
   ```

3. **Optimization Solver Requirement**  
   - The code uses [Gurobi Optimizer](https://www.gurobi.com/) to solve the mathematical model.
   - **A valid Gurobi license is required.**  
     Refer to the [Gurobi documentation](https://www.gurobi.com/documentation/) for installation and licensing details.
